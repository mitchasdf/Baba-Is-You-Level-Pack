# Baba-Is-You-Level-Pack
An open-source level pack for baba is you.

Though it has 8 zones placed in the overworld map with an intended theme for each, only the first zone is finished at the moment.
That is; 7 levels plus a prelude level.

After downloading the repository (by clicking the code button and then download zip), copy the "baba_has_journey" folder into your Worlds folder. Example:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baba Is You\Data\Worlds\baba_has_journey

Make sure to reboot the game once the folder is copied in. Or to be even safer, just make sure the game is closed when you copy it in.

The project is completely open source. Do what ever you wish to the level pack. Complete it with your own levels or change it as much as you want and redistribute it if need be. The MIT license allows for this.

I worked on this last year and tested prior to the time of uploading to github. The levels within are completable.
